# Model Training, Evaluation, Validation
## Model Training 
  - incrementally improve model's predictive ability.
## Model Evaluation
  - Model evaluation consists of a person or a group of people evaluating or assessing the model, with respect to some business-relevant metric like AUC, area under the curve, or cost weighted error.
  - If the model meets their criteria, it is moved from the assessment phase to development.For example, in the development phase, you may want to modify hyperparameter values to increase the model's performance, which correlates to improvements in evaluation results.
  - After development, the model is then ready for a live experiment or real-world test of the model.

## Model Validation
  - In contrast to the model evaluation component, which is performed by humans, the model validation component evaluates the model against fixed thresholds and alerts engineers when things go wrong.
